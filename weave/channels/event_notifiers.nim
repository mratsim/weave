# This file implements a backoff strategy for workers that have nothing to do.
# This is key to avoid burning CPU cycles for nothing and save on power consumption.
#
# There are a couple of areas where backoff can be considered:
# - Sending a steal request
# - Checking incoming steal requests
# - Relaying steal requests
# - Checking incoming tasks
#
# Challenges:
#
# - In Weave, delay in checking and/or relaying steal requests affect all the
#   potential thieves.
#   In other runtimes, a thief that backs off will wake up with 0 task,
#   in Weave it may wake up with 10 steal requests queued.
#
# As each thread as a parent, a thread that backed off can temporarily give up ownership
# of its steal request channel to its parent instead
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Backoff strategies
#
# There seems to be 2 main strategies worth exploring:
# - Consider that each processors work as if in a distributed system
#   and reuse research inspired from Wifi/Radio stations, especially
#   on wakeup strategies to limit spurious wakeups.
#   Extensive research is done at the end.
#
# - Augment the relevant channels with a companion MPSC
#   event signaling system.
#   This completely removes spurious wakeups but only applicable
#   for shared memory systems.
#
# Extensive research details on distributed backoff
# are provided in the corresponding markdown file
#
# The current file has been formally specified and verified
# Formal specification is available at project_root/formal_verification/event_notifiers.tla
