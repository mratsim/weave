    ## Communication channels
    ## This is a global objects and so must be stored
    ## at a global place.
    # - Nim seq uses thread-local heaps
    #   and are not recommended.
    # - ptr UncheckedArray would work and would
    #   be useful if Channels are packed in the same
    #   heap (with padding to avoid cache conflicts)
    # - A global unitialized array
    #   so they are stored on the BSS segment
    #   (no storage used just size + fixed memory offset)
    #   would work but then it requires a pointer indirection
    #   per channel
    #   and a known max number of workers

    # Theft channels is bounded to "NumWorkers * WV_MaxConcurrentStealPerWorker"
