  BoundedQueue*[Capacity: static int, T] = object
    ## Queue with bounded capacity.
    ## The buffer is inline, no heap allocation is required.
    ##
    ## The bounded queue has been fine-tuned for:
    ##   - Memory efficiency: buffer the size of the capacity.
    ##     Unlike many implementations that either require
    ##     a power of 2 size
    ##     or an extra empty slot to differentiate between full and empty.
    ##     This is important as stack space is at a premium.
    ##   - Compute efficiency: no modulo operation (by non-power of 2).
    ##     Modulo is one of the slowest builtin operations and about
    ##     10x slower than other builtins like add, mul, and, or, shifts ...
    ##     Reference: https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf

    # To differentiate between full and empty case
    # we don't rollover the front and back indices to 0

    # but only when they reach 2*capacity.
