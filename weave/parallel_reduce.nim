  ## Parallel for loop
  ## Syntax:
  ##
  ##   var waitableSum: Flowvar[int]
  ##   parallelFor i in 0 ..< 100:
  ##     reduce(waitableSum):
  ##       prologue:
  ##         ## Initialize before the loop
  ##         var localSum = 0
  ##       fold:
  ##         ## Compute the partial reductions
  ##         localSum += i
  ##       merge(remoteSum):
  ##         ## Merge our local reduction with reduction from remote threads
  ##         ## And return
  ##         localSum += sync(remoteSum)
  ##       return localSum
  ##
  ##   # Await our result
  ##   let sum = sync(waitableSum)
  ##
  ## The first element from the iterator (i) in the example is not available in the prologue.
  ## Depending on multithreaded scheduling it may start at 0 or halfway or close to completion.
  ## The accumulator set in the prologue should be set at the neutral element for your fold operation:
  ## - 0 for addition, 1 for multiplication, +Inf for min, -Inf for max, ...
  ##
  ## In the fold section the iterator i is available, the number of iterations can be cut short
  ## if scheduling the rest on other cores would be faster overall.
  ## - This requires your operation to be associative, i.e. (a+b)+c = a+(b+c).
  ## - It does not require your operation to be commutative (a+b = b+a is not needed).
  ## - In particular floating-point addition is NOT associative due to rounding errors.
  ##   and result may differ between runs.
  ##   For inputs usually in [-1,1]
  ##   the floating point addition error is within 1e-8 (float32) or 1e-15 (float64).
  ##   For inputs beyond 1e^9 please evaluate the acceptable precision.
  ##   Note: that the main benefits of "-ffast-math" is considering floating-point addition
  ##         associative
  ##
  ## In the merge section, an identifier for a partial reduction from a remote core must be passed.
  ## Its type will be a waitable Flowvar of the same type as your local partial reduction
  ## The local partial reduction must be returned.
  ##
  ## Variables from the external scope needs to be explicitly captured.
  ## For example, to compute the variance of a seq in parallel
  ##
  ##    var s = newSeqWith(1000, rand(100.0))
  ##    let mean = mean(s)
  ##
  ##    let ps = cast[ptr UncheckedArray[float64]](s)
  ##    var waitableVariance: Flowvar[float64]
  ##
  ##    parallelFor i in 0 ..< s.len:
  ##      captures: {ps, mean}
  ##      reduce(variance):
  ##        prologue:
  ##          var localVariance = 0.0
  ##        fold:
  ##          localVariance += (ps[i] - mean)^2
  ##        merge(remoteVariance):
  ##          localVariance += sync(remoteVariance)
  ##        return localVariance
  ##
  ##    # Await our result
  ##    let variance = sync(waitableVariance)
  ##
  ## Performance note:
  ##   For trivial floating points operations like addition/sum reduction:
  ##   before parallelizing reductions on multiple cores
  ##   you might try to parallelize it on a single core by
  ##   creating multiple accumulators (between 2 and 4)
  ##   and unrolling the accumulation loop by that amount.
  ##
  ##   The compiler is unable to do that (without -ffast-math)
  ##   as floating point addition is NOT associative and changing
  ##   order will change the result due to floating point rounding errors.
  ##
  ##   The performance improvement is dramatic (2x-3x) as at a low-level
  ##   there is no data dependency between each accumulators and
  ##   the CPU can now use instruction-level parallelism instead
  ##   of suffer from data dependency latency (3 or 4 cycles)
  ##   https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#techs=SSE&expand=158
  ##   The reduction becomes memory-bound instead of CPU-latency-bound.
