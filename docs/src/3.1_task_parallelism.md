# Task parallelism

Weave provides a simple API based on spawn/sync which works like async/await for IO-based futures.

The traditional parallel recursive fibonacci would be written like this:
```Nim
import weave

proc fib(n: int): int =
  # int64 on x86-64
  if n < 2:
    return n

  let x = spawn fib(n-1)
  let y = fib(n-2)

  result = sync(x) + y

proc main() =
  var n = 20

  init(Weave)
  let f = fib(n)
  exit(Weave)

  echo f

main()
```
