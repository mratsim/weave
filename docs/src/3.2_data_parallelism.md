# Data parallelism

Weave provides nestable parallel for loop.

A nested matrix transposition would be written like this:

```Nim
import weave

func initialize(buffer: ptr UncheckedArray[float32], len: int) =
  for i in 0 ..< len:
    buffer[i] = i.float32

proc transpose(M, N: int, bufIn, bufOut: ptr UncheckedArray[float32]) =
  ## Transpose a MxN matrix into a NxM matrix with nested for loops

  parallelFor j in 0 ..< N:
    captures: {M, N, bufIn, bufOut}
    parallelFor i in 0 ..< M:
      captures: {j, M, N, bufIn, bufOut}
      bufOut[j*M+i] = bufIn[i*N+j]

proc main() =
  let M = 200
  let N = 2000

  let input = newSeq[float32](M*N)
  # We can't work with seq directly as it's managed by GC, take a ptr to the buffer.
  let bufIn = cast[ptr UncheckedArray[float32]](input[0].unsafeAddr)
  bufIn.initialize(M*N)

  var output = newSeq[float32](N*M)
  let bufOut = cast[ptr UncheckedArray[float32]](output[0].addr)

  init(Weave)
  transpose(M, N, bufIn, bufOut)
  exit(Weave)

main()
```

# Strided loops

You might want to use loops with a non unit-stride, this can be done with the following syntax.

```Nim
import weave

init(Weave)

# expandMacros:
parallelForStrided i in 0 ..< 100, stride = 30:
  parallelForStrided j in 0 ..< 200, stride = 60:
    captures: {i}
    log("Matrix[%d, %d] (thread %d)\n", i, j, myID())

exit(Weave)
```
